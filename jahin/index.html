   <p style="color:#800000">Fresh from sealing the £55 million ($70m) deal for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Manchester United are keen to continue their summer spending spree with the signings of James Maddison and Sean Longstaff.

According to The Times, central midfielder Longstaff is on United's wishlist after impressing in his nine Premier League appearances, with Newcastle United valuing the 21-year-old at £25m ($32m).

Maddison, who has also been linked with Tottenham, has caught the eye of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following a debut top-flight campaign with Leicester City that saw him score seven goals and get seven assists.

The 22-year-old will likely cost the Red Devils £60m ($76m) with the English playmaker on the brink of a international debut having been included in the Three Lions' squad for matches last October against Croatia and Spain.</p>

   <p style="color:#800000;">Former Inter defender Marco Materazzi has claimed Antonio Conte wants to bring Roma’s Eden Dzeko and Manchester United’s Romelu Lukaku to San Siro this summer.

“The club is ambitious and want to sign three-four important players,” he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 

“Conte demands Dzeko and Lukaku and he is right because he is also very ambitious and he knows how to do his job. 

"For sure he wants to beat Juventus. [Mauro] Icardi? I don't know what happened so it's better if I remain silent,” he added.</p>
